2. **Project Motivation**
    My goal is to perform descriptive analysis on data from one of the most popular sport leagues in India called the Indian Premier League. This is a Cricket League that is played every summer in India and one of the most watched sporting leagues in the world. League data is collected for the year range 2008-2019. This is a descriptive analysis of the league data which aims to introduce the league to the unintiated. Questions addressed are
        1. How many teams  participated in the league every season?
        2. Who is the better team in terms of winning percentages? Check the trends based on season
        3. Which captain makes a successful choice at the toss which results in an eventual win of the game? Check trends based on season
        4. There is a hypothesis that teams to tend accelerate - score at a higher average - post 15 overs. Perform a statistical test to check the validity of this claim
